# Project Movies
This is a project that was made during the Technigo Bootcamp. The assignment was built with React and we worked with an external API.  

## The problem
We started with building all the components in App, and then we moved them to separate pages/components. 

If we had more time we would work more with cathing errors. We explored this a bit but we could not make it work so we had to remove it in the end.
We would also move all the urls into the right folder. 

We also had a little bit of problem to make the animation on 'BackButton' to have a smooth transition back to its original position.
